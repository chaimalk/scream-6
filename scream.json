Williamson also said that he would likely not be involved in any further entries, as the series director Wes Craven and his team were done with him.In Williamson's initial pitch, Scream 5 saw Jill Roberts being stalked by a killer at her college campus, while Scream 6 would feature Gale Weathers as the main character and deal with her relationship with Dewey Riley.[16] In January 2022, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, and Tyler Gillett expressed interest in making future films in the series.[17] Courteney Cox would later express an interest in a sequel while doing publicity for Shining Vale.[18] A sixth film was officially green-lit on February 3, 2022, by Spyglass Media Group. Olpin and Gillett of Radio Silence would return to direct while James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick would write the script once again.[19] By the end of the month, Campbell was approached to return for the film.[20] The following month, Cox had received the script and was courted to reprise her role.[21] Also in March 2022, the sixth film's release date was set for March 31, 2023.[22] By May, plot details emerged, setting the film outside of Woodsboro. Instead, the film will take place in New York City. In June, Ortega said the film would feature a more aggressive and violent Ghostface than in previous entries.",
